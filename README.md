The following data set contains eeg data that was taken from the OpenBCI device. At KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belgaum, Karnataka India.

The main objective for the collection of this data was to collect data of a subject to determine his/her negative emotions.
The following procedure was followed in order to record the EEG data:
1) A set of experiments were conducted in order to test the cognitive abilities of a person.
Each task assigned was irrespective of the age group 
& was determined on the basis of stress levels and mental ability.
2) When the subject entered, first we took the initial BP reading of the subject, we then connected device to the subject and tested if the data was being collected in the proper manner with the proper settings in our computer (OpenBCI Application Interface).
3) The subject then was given a task and the EEG reading was recorded. Each task was easier compared to the next one. Higher the tasks more the difficulty in this order we manage that the subject  underwent stress.
4) We then collected the data of the subject while in the rest position, the subject was told to meditate for about two and a half minute and we collected the EEG data during this period.
5) The data was collected into 2 different forms one the training set data, that was collected when the subject had to undergo the tasks, and the second set of data was collected when the subject was undergoing meditation that is relaxation.
6) We then provided a Google form consisting of different questions that were framed by the guidance of psychiatrists, these questions help us add more information about the subject while determining the stress of the subject.
